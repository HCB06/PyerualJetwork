NN (Neural Networks) on CPU
============================
This module hosts functions for training and evaluating artificial neural networks on CPU for labeled classification tasks.

Currently, 3 types of models can be trained:

    PLAN (Potentiation Learning Artificial Neural Network)
        * Training Time for Small Projects: fast
        * Training Time for Big Projects: fast
        * Explainability: high
        * Learning Capacity: medium (compared to single perceptrons)

    MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron → Deep Learning) -- With non-bias
        * Training Time for Small Projects: fast
        * Training Time for Big Projects: slow
        * Explainability: low
        * Learning Capacity: high

    PTNN (Potentiation Transfer Neural Network) -- With non-bias
        * Training Time for Small Projects: fast
        * Training Time for Big Projects: fast
        * Explainability: low
        * Learning Capacity: high

    """
    Optimizes the activation functions for a neural network by leveraging train data to find 
    the most accurate combination of activation potentiation(or activation function) & weight values for the labeled classificaiton dataset.

    Why genetic optimization ENE(Eugenic NeuroEvolution) and not backpropagation?
    Because PLAN is different from other neural network architectures. In PLAN, the learnable parameters are not the weights; instead, the learnable parameters are the activation functions.
    Since activation functions are not differentiable, we cannot use gradient descent or backpropagation. However, I developed a more powerful genetic optimization algorithm: ENE.

    * This function also able to train classic MLP model architectures.
    * And my newest innovative architecture: PTNN (Potentiation Transfer Neural Network).

    Examples:
    
        This creates a PLAN model: 
            - ```learn(x_train, y_train, optimizer, pop_size=100, gen=100, fit_start=True) ```

        This creates a MLP model(with 2 hidden layer): 
            - ```learn(x_train, y_train, optimizer, pop_size=100, gen=100, fit_start=False, neurons=[64, 64], activation_functions=['tanh', 'tanh']) ```
        
        This creates a PTNN model(with 2 hidden layer & 1 aggregation layer(comes with PLAN)): 
           -  ```learn(x_train, y_train, optimizer, pop_size=100, gen=[10, 100], fit_start=True, neurons=[64, 64], activation_functions=['tanh', 'tanh']) ```
    
    :Args:
    :param x_train: (array-like): Training input data.
    :param y_train: (array-like): Labels for training data. one-hot encoded.
    :param optimizer: (function): Optimization technique with hyperparameters. (PLAN, MLP & PTNN (all) using ENE for optimization. Gradient based technique's will added in the future.) Please use this: from pyerualjetwork.cpu.ene import evolver (and) optimizer = lambda *args, **kwargs: evolver(*args, 'here give your hyperparameters for example:  activation_add_prob=0.85', **kwargs) Example:
    ```python
             optimizer = lambda *args, **kwargs: ene.evolver(*args,
                                                            activation_add_prob=0.05,

                            gen=15,

    ```
    :param fit_start: (bool, optional): If the fit_start parameter is set to True, the initial generation population undergoes a simple short training process using the PLAN algorithm. This allows for a very robust starting point, especially for large and complex datasets. However, for small or relatively simple datasets, it may result in unnecessary computational overhead. When fit_start is True, completing the first generation may take slightly longer (this increase in computational cost applies only to the first generation and does not affect subsequent generations). If fit_start is set to False, the initial population will be entirely random. Additonaly if you want to train PTNN model you must be give True. Options: True or False. Default: True
    :param gen: (int or list): The generation count for genetic optimization. If you want to train PTNN model you must give a list of two number. First number for PLAN model training second number for MLP.
    :param batch_size: (float, optional): Batch size is used in the prediction process to receive train feedback by dividing the train data into chunks and selecting activations based on randomly chosen partitions. This process reduces computational cost and time while still covering the entire train set due to random selection, so it doesn't significantly impact accuracy. For example, a batch size of 0.08 means each train batch represents %8 of the train set. Default is 1. (%100 of train)
    :param pop_size: (int): Population size of each generation.
    :param weight_evolve: (bool, optional): Activation combinations already optimizes by ENE genetic search algorithm. Should the weight parameters also evolve or should the weights be determined according to the aggregating learning principle of the PLAN algorithm? Default: True (Evolves Weights)
    :param neural_web_history: (bool, optional): Draws history of neural web. Default is False. [ONLY FOR PLAN MODELS]
    :param show_current_activations: (bool, optional): Should it display the activations selected according to the current strategies during learning, or not? (True or False) This can be very useful if you want to cancel the learning process and resume from where you left off later. After canceling, you will need to view the live training activations in order to choose the activations to be given to the 'start_this' parameter. Default is False
    :param auto_normalization: (bool, optional): Normalization may solves overflow problem. Default: False
    :param neurons_history: (bool, optional): Shows the history of changes that neurons undergo during the ENE optimization process. True or False. Default is False. [ONLY FOR PLAN MODELS]
    :param early_stop: (bool, optional): If True, implements early stopping during training.(If accuracy not improves in two gen stops learning.) Default is False.
    :param show_history: (bool, optional): If True, displays the training history after optimization. Default is False.
    :param target_loss: (float, optional): The target loss to stop training early when achieved. Default is None.
    :param interval: (int, optional): The interval at which evaluations are conducted during training. (33.33 = 30 FPS, 16.67 = 60 FPS) Default is 100.
    :param target_acc: (float, optional): The target accuracy to stop training early when achieved. Default is None.
    :param loss: (str, optional): options: ('categorical_crossentropy' or 'binary_crossentropy') Default is 'categorical_crossentropy'.
    :param acc_impact: (float, optional): Impact of accuracy for optimization [0-1]. Default: 0.9
    :param loss_impact: (float, optional): Impact of loss for optimization [0-1]. Default: 0.1
    :param start_this_act: (list, optional): To resume a previously canceled or interrupted training from where it left off, or to continue from that point with a different strategy, provide the list of activation functions selected up to the learned portion to this parameter. Default is None
    :param start_this_W: (numpy.array, optional): To resume a previously canceled or interrupted training from where it left off, or to continue from that point with a different strategy, provide the weight matrix of this genome. Default is None
    :param neurons: (list[int], optional): If you dont want train PLAN model this parameter represents neuron count of each hidden layer for MLP or PTNN. Number of elements --> Layer count. Default: [] (No hidden layer) --> architecture setted to PLAN, if not --> architecture setted to MLP.
    :param activation_functions: (list[str], optional): If you dont want train PLAN model this parameter represents activation function of each hidden layer for MLP or PTNN. if neurons is not [] --> uses default: ['linear'] * len(neurons). if neurons is [] --> uses [].
    :param dtype: (numpy.dtype): Data type for the Weight matrices. np.float32 by default. Example: np.float64 or np.float16.

    Returns:
        tuple: A list for model parameters: [Weight matrix, Train Preds, Train Accuracy, [Activations functions]].
